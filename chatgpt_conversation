The image you uploaded shows two spectral plots related to radio observations, likely from an astronomical source. Here's a breakdown of what the plots represent:
Left Plot: "Observed spectrum"

    X-axis: Frequency (Hz), centered around 1.4205 GHz ‚Äî this is the hydrogen line (HI 21 cm line).

    Top axis: Radial velocity (km/s) ‚Äî showing how much the signal is Doppler shifted.

    Y-axis: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in dB ‚Äî a measure of the signal strength relative to background noise.

    Green Line: Actual observed data.

    Red Dotted Line: Theoretical frequency of the hydrogen line (rest frame).

Observation:

    The hydrogen line appears slightly offset from the theoretical frequency, indicating a Doppler shift due to motion (e.g., of the emitting gas or the Earth).

Right Plot: "Corrected spectrum w.r.t. LSR"

    LSR stands for Local Standard of Rest, a reference frame that accounts for the Sun's motion around the galaxy.

    This plot shows the same data but corrected for motion relative to the LSR.

    The hydrogen line now better aligns with the theoretical frequency.

Observation:

    This alignment confirms the Doppler correction was applied effectively.

    The feature at ~1.4205 GHz aligns better with the red dashed line after correction.

Summary:

    You're looking at HI 21 cm line observations.

    The left panel shows uncorrected data; the right shows the data corrected for motion relative to the LSR.

    The red dashed line is the theoretical rest frequency of the HI line (~1.420405 GHz).

    The correction improves alignment with this rest frequency, validating the calibration and velocity correction process.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like help analyzing the SNR values, extracting radial velocities, or anything else related to this plot.

this tone or attenuation?
ChatGPT said:

This plot shows signal attenuation, not tone.

Let me clarify:
üîç Tone vs. Attenuation
Tone:

    A "tone" refers to a pure frequency signal (like a sine wave at a specific frequency).

    In spectrum plots, a tone would appear as a sharp, narrow spike at a particular frequency.

Attenuation:

    Attenuation refers to the reduction in signal strength.

    It‚Äôs often shown via Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or power levels across frequencies.

‚úÖ What the Plot Shows:

    Y-axis is Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB, so it's measuring how strong the signal is relative to background noise.

    The green line (observed data) shows how SNR varies across frequencies.

    The general shape ‚Äî a dip and rise ‚Äî shows frequency-dependent signal strength, possibly due to system response, atmospheric effects, or RFI (Radio Frequency Interference).

    The sharp peaks are narrowband signals (could be real spectral lines or interference), but the rest of the curve represents attenuation or background structure.

üü¢ Conclusion:

This is attenuation, showing how signal strength varies across frequency.
There are also spectral lines (or "tones") visible in the form of spikes, but the overall trend is attenuation-related.

Let me know if you want to isolate the spectral lines or model the attenuation curve.

let mee zoom it for you:

Thanks for zooming in!

With this closer view of the observed spectrum near 1.4205 GHz, we can see the following details more clearly:
üîé Analysis of the Zoomed Region:
üìå Red Dotted Line:

    Marks the theoretical rest frequency of the neutral hydrogen (HI) line:
    1.42040575177 GHz

    This is where the signal would appear if there were no Doppler shift (i.e., the gas is at rest relative to the observer).

üìà Green Curve (Observed Data):

    Shows a clear peak just slightly to the left of the red line.

    That means the observed HI line is slightly redshifted ‚Üí the source has a positive radial velocity (moving away from the observer).

    The SNR peak is broadened and asymmetric, possibly due to:

        Thermal motion of the hydrogen gas.

        Multiple overlapping sources or velocity components.

        Instrumental effects.

‚úÖ What This Is NOT:

    Not a pure tone: This isn‚Äôt a narrow spike like you'd see from an artificial signal.

    Not a flat attenuation curve: Instead, it shows a spectral line feature embedded within some attenuation or background noise.

üü¢ Conclusion:

This zoomed-in region shows a real spectral line ‚Äî likely the redshifted 21 cm HI line ‚Äî observed from neutral hydrogen gas.
It‚Äôs a clear astrophysical signal, not an artificial tone, and not just attenuation.

Let me know if you want to:

    Measure the radial velocity shift.

    Estimate line width or intensity.

    Compare this to the LSR-corrected version.
